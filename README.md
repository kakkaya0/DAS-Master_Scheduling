# DAS_Master_Scheduling
This repository implements a Master Scheduling algorithm for Demand Adaprive Services, which was published in the following paper [Link to paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-010-0710-5). The algorithm can be used to determine the master schedule of a single DAS line,
that is, determining the time windows for the compulsory stops of the line.
